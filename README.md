# credit-risk-classification
  In this Challenge we will be using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. We use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Repo Overview
  For this challenge, a new repository named 'Credit-risk-classification' was created. It was then cloned to the local computer, where new folder(Credit_risk) were added into the repository. This folder contains the final Jupyter Notebook where all the anlysis were performed. The repository was then pushed back to github.
